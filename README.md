A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is a 128‑bit number used to identify information in computer systems. The term Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) is also used, typically in connection with Microsoft (e.g., software, registry).

When generated according to standard methods, UUIDs can be considered globally unique for practical purposes. Although the probability that a UUID will be duplicated is not zero, it is so small that the likelihood of a collision is generally negligible. One advantage of UUIDs—unlike most other numbering schemes—is their independence from a central registration authority or coordination between parties.

Therefore, anyone can create a UUID and use it to identify an object, with the highest confidence that the identifier will not duplicate another identifier already created or one that may be created in the future for a different object.

The use of UUIDs and GUIDs is widespread. Many computer platforms provide support for generating and parsing their textual representation.

It was standardized by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) as part of the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) and is now defined in RFC 4122.

A UUID consists of a 16‑byte number, written in hexadecimal and divided into five groups. In its canonical form, a UUID looks like this:
